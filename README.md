# terraform

### Test comment

This repo is comprised of terraform code used to create AWS infrastructure for Sandata.

For now, terraform plans and applies are being run from your local CLI. We'll be transitioning this to a VCS-backed run in the near future.

## Creating a new workspace

- Create a new folder with a generic name. Don't use environment-specific naming to identify what your terraform code is going to do
- Copy `tfc.tf` and `providers.tf` into your new directory. You can grab these files from just about any existing workspace
- In your `tfc.tf` file, change `prefix` in the backend block to your folder name, followed by a hyphen ("-")
- Create a new workspace for an environment by running `terraform workspace create <environment>-<short_region>`. For example, `terraform workspace create rd-ue1` would create a workspace for the `rd` environment that belongs to the `us-east-1` region.
  - **Do not stray from this naming convention and PLEASE check your spelling.**
- Make sure you have your new workspace selected: `terraform workspace select rd-ue1`

## How do I run a plan/apply for a specific workspace?

- `cd` to the appropriate directory
- Run `terraform init` if needed
- Ensure you're on the correct workspace using `terraform workspace list`
  - If you're not, select the correct workspace with `terraform workspace select <workspace>`
- Run `terraform plan` and `terraform apply` like normal
